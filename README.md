# css-reset
Aims to ensure rendering consistency across different browsers.

---

## PROBLEM 👎🏼
Inconsistent default stylesheets across web browsers create disparities in how elements like margins, padding, line heights, and font sizes are rendered, compromising web design uniformity and user experience.

## SOLUTION 👍🏼
CSS reset is utilized to standardize these inconsistencies by overriding most default styles with a basic set of rules. This offers developers a clean slate, free from browser-specific defaults, facilitating a more consistent design across all browsers.

**NOTE:** This reset is opinionated, reflecting **my** preferred defaults.
